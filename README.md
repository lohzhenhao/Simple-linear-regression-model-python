# Simple-linear-regression-model-python
This is a very simple Linear regression model to do multiplications, i made this in a few days after learning the basics so it is a pretty bare bones model.
Its not even that accurate...
The lowest loss it can go to is 0.00000000000409272615797817707061767578125.
I THINK its because the weights and bias do not start from 0 but no way to tell rn.
